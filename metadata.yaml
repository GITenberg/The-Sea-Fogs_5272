description: Robert Louis Stevenson first came to California in 1879 for the purpose
  of getting married. The things that delayed his marriage are sufficiently set forth
  in his Letters (edited by Sidney Colvin) and in his Life (written by Graham Balfour).
  It is here necessary to refer only to the last of the obstacles, the breaking down
  of his health. It is in connection with the evil thing that came to him at this
  time that be first makes mention of the sea fogs, that beset a large part of the
  California coast.
